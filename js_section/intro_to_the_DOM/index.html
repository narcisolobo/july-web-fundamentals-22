    <h2>Document Object Model - A model of the document as an object.</h2>

    <h3>An Object is reference datatype with key: value pairs.</h3>

    <p>An object IRL has characteristics and things it can do. For instance, a car has a make, a model, number of wheels, a color, etc. These are the characteristics of the car. A car can also drive, it can also beep, etc. These are things a car can do.</p>
    <p>In JS - we call these characteristics <em>properties</em>.</p>
    <p>And we call things an object can do <em>methods</em>. A method is just a function that belongs to an object.</p>
    <p>How do we create an object in JS?</p>
